"""Setup self-check: `uv run python -m server.doctor`.

Verifies the three things a fresh install needs — a new-enough Python, a working
Stockfish binary, and (optionally) the `claude` CLI for the in-browser chat — and
prints exactly what's missing with a copy-pasteable fix. Exit code 0 means the core
(Python + Stockfish) is ready; the `claude` CLI is reported but never fails the check.
