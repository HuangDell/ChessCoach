"""Mistake puzzles from the user's own games (P3.5) — the "From your games" source.

Resurface positions where the player themselves went wrong in a past analysed game as engine-
validated practice. Unlike a curated tactic there's no single forced line: acceptance is eval-based
(any move whose win% drop is under the game's inaccuracy threshold passes), so a positional spot has
several right answers while a real missed tactic has one. These are **always unrated** (they never
touch the Glicko rating) and spaced-repetition gated.

Engine-free here: candidates come straight from the stored history records (each flagged mistake
already carries `fen_before`, the played + best move, the win% drop, and motif tags). Only the move
the user *submits* is evaluated live, by `routes_puzzles` via `lines.engine_line`. Best-effort: any
failure just yields no puzzle, never an exception into the board.

# a mid-rated (~1400) player targeting only ~p62 of their own swings (just above their median),
