"""Endgame tablebase probe via the public Lichess tablebase API (Syzygy, <=7 men).

In the endgame a depth-limited eval is fuzzy — "+1.2" tells the coach almost nothing about
whether a position is actually *won*. A tablebase gives the EXACT theoretical result
(win/draw/loss) plus distance-to-zeroing/mate for any position with <=7 pieces, so coaching in
those positions is precise instead of a guess. We hit the free public Lichess tablebase
(https://tablebase.lichess.ovh) — same dependency (`httpx`) and best-effort posture as
`lichess.py`: any failure (offline, rate limit, parse) returns None and the caller simply omits
the fact. Only the chat / coach-summary path probes (it passes `probe_tablebase=True` to
`engine_line`); the interactive board never does, so the hot path stays network-free.

`CHESS_TABLEBASE=0` disables it entirely.
