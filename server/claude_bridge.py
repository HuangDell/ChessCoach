"""Bridge to headless Claude Code for the in-browser chat (Phase 6).

Shells out to `claude -p` so the browser's "why?" questions are answered on the user's
Claude subscription (the separate Agent SDK credit), NOT the per-token API. We pass the
chess MCP config + pre-approve the chess tools so Claude grounds its answer in real engine
lines via `get_engine_line`.

When an optional ``.mcp.json`` exists, the Claude CLI may request additional engine lines through
MCP. Without it, the bridge still works from the engine facts embedded in the prompt; the Web core
therefore never requires the MCP package or configuration.

    `fen` is the board the user is viewing (for "what should I do here?"); `last_move`/`move_fen`
    are the move in question and the position it was played from (for "why is this bad?"). When the
    move is the one available at the current board they coincide and we analyse once.

    `use_profile` opts the question into personalised coaching: the current player's cross-game
